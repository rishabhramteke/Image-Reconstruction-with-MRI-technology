# Image-Reconstruction-with-MRI-technology

Awarded the Undergraduate Research Award for this notable contribution.
Implemented a modified version of GRAPPA algorithm on SDK for image reconstruction with parallel MRI technology which would be used in the indigenous state-of-art MRI Machines.
Simulated the algorithm on Matlab and then implemented it on Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA board.

The main MATLAB code is grappa.m

The main C++ code is grappainc.cpp
